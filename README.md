## Hello 👋
[Portfolio](https://www.satvik.site) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satvik-kasinadhuni) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChubbyIndianBoy)

I am Satvik 🧑, currently a high school sophomore 🎓, and a person who is super interested in Software Development 💻, Cyber Security, and startups 🏢!

Most of my work is done in JavaScript, but I have also worked with Python 🐍, Java ☕, C#, and C++!

I am currently working on two projects, [MechLevels](https://github.com/KasinadhuniProgrammer/MechLevels), and Resumer. Apart from just working on projects, I am getting prepared with starting with Competitive Programming, and I am taking many crash courses on Full Stack Development 🔥, and Cyber Security ⚡️.

When I am not building crazy projects, doing Competitive Programming, or just learning more about Computer Science and Software Development in general, you will find me watching too much Clement Mihailescu on Youtube 📺, or playing too much SSBU 🕹️.
