## Hey there! I am Satvik Kasinadhuni
I am currently a Sophomore at Farmington High School based in Connecticut. I am very passionate for coding and am interested to go into the Computational Biology field!

I love to develop Full Stack Applications using React.js and Firebase. I am currently learning Xcode in order to start developing IOS Apps!

GitHub is like my office on the web(home on the web is my personal website!). Literally all the code I write for my projects are here.
