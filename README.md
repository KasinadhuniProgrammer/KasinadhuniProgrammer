## Hello 👋
[Portfolio](https://www.satvik.site) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satvik-kasinadhuni) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChubbyIndianBoy)

I am Satvik 🧑, currently a high school sophomore 🎓, and a person who is super interested in Software Development 💻, and startups 🏢!

Most of my work is done in JavaScript, but I have also worked with Python 🐍, Java ☕, C#, and C++!

I am currently working on two projects, [MechLevels](https://github.com/KasinadhuniProgrammer/MechLevels), and Resumer.

When I am not building crazy projects, or just learning more about Computer Science and Software Development in general, you will find me watching too much Clement Mihailescu on Youtube 📺, or playing too much SSBU 🕹️.

## Random Facts about me!
- Favorite Programming Language(s): Python and JavaScript, I cannot choose one
- Dream Job: Cyber Security Engineer at Lockheed Martin
- Dream College: Worcester Polytechnic Institute
