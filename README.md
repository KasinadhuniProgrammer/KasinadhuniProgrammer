## Hello 👋
[Portfolio](https://www.satvik.site) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satvik-kasinadhuni) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChubbyIndianBoy)

I am Satvik 🧑, currently a high school sophomore 🎓, and a person who is super interested in Software Development 💻 and Ethical Hacking ⌨️!

Most of my work here on my GitHub is done in JavaScript, but I also have experience developing Tcl/Tk applications in Python, and am also fluent in the Java programming language.

I am currently working on two projects, [MechLevels](https://github.com/KasinadhuniProgrammer/MechLevels), and Resumer.

Apart from learning and practicing Software Engineering, I also am learning about Biomedical Engineering and trying out what that is like also, as I am always learning about different fields in Engineering.
