### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Satvik Kasinadhuni, welcome to my GitHub! Over here, you will find all my code to the projects I work on either myself or with a team.  

### About me
I am currently a sophomore at Farmington High School(FHS class of 2023!) in Connecticut, United States of America. I am an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer, and I am also a competitive programmer. My strongest programming languages are C++ and Python, I use JavaScript when I develop websites but JavaScript is not my strongest. I also LOVE Algorithms and Data Structures. Computer Programming is my passion! I may not be the best at it, but building software is something I enjoy doing. Some of my hobbies are, playing and watching cricket, gaming, and biking!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 3 software projects 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning OpenCV and more about TensorFlow
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything Competitive Programming related and I will try my best to answer! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: skasinad@gmail.com is the best way to reach out to me as I am more active on my emails
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His 
- âš¡ Plans after High School: I am interested to go to college and major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Eventually I want to become a Machine Learning Engineer and work for a good company.
