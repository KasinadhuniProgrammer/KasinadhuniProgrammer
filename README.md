## Hey there! I am Satvik Kasinadhuni
I am currently a Sophomore at Farmington High School based in Connecticut. I love to develop Full Stack Applications using React.js and Firebase.

When I say the web is like a second world to me, I mean it. GitHub is like my office on the web(home on the web is my personal website!). Literally all the code I write for my projects are here. My park on the web(place where I hangout and chill) is the Hack Club Slack, I love the Hack Club Slack!! I am making so many new friends there who have the same interests and passions as me. I am also learning so much from them and spreading the knowledge I have to others! And finally, my home sweet home on the web, my personal website.
