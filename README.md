## Hello 👋
[Portfolio](https://www.satvik.site) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satvik-kasinadhuni) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChubbyIndianBoy)

I am Satvik 🧑, currently a high school sophomore 🎓, and a person who is super interested in Software Development 💻 and Ethical Hacking ⌨️!

Most of my work here on my GitHub is done in JavaScript, but I also have experience developing Tk/Tcl applications in Python, and am also fluent in the Java programming language.

I am currently working on two projects, [MechLevels](https://github.com/KasinadhuniProgrammer/MechLevels), and Resumer.

When I am not building crazy projects, or just learning more about Computer Science and Software Development in general, you will find me watching too much Clement Mihailescu on Youtube 📺, or playing too much SSBU 🕹️.
