## Hello 👋

I am Satvik 🧑, currently a high school sophomore 🎓, and a person who is super interested in Software Development 💻!

Most of my work here on my GitHub is done in JavaScript, but I also have experience developing Tcl/Tk applications in Python, and am also fluent in the Java programming language.

I am currently working on two projects, [MechLevels](https://github.com/KasinadhuniProgrammer/MechLevels), and Resumer.
